## 🔹 **What This Tool Does**  
This tool helps **3D printing enthusiasts** identify the **exact colors needed** to print their favorite Pokémon.  
Simply type in a Pokémon’s name, and the app will analyze its color palette to:  
✅ Recommend **PLA filament colors**  
✅ Suggest **popular filament brands** and their corresponding product numbers  
✅ Estimate **how much filament** is needed for your print  

## 🔹 **The Learning Process**  
This project was **my own creation**, developed after following some of **TechWithLucy’s tutorials** and **digging deeper into learning PartyRock**.  
At first, I explored the basics, but as I gained confidence, I started tweaking the app to **fit real-world needs**—especially for my buddy’s 3D printing business.  

## 🔹 **Ensuring Accuracy**  
Initially, the tool **struggled to remember white and black**—which are essential for Pokémon with **eyes and outlines**.  
To fix this, I updated the logic so it **always includes white and black filament when necessary**.  

## 🔹 **Brand-Specific Filament Matching**  
Different filament brands use **unique color names**, so I refined the app to **list popular brands** alongside their product codes.  
This helps users find **the best match** for their prints without guessing!  

## 🔹 **Fun Bonus Feature: AI-Generated Pokémon Images!**  
At the bottom of the results, the app creates a **random AI-generated image** based on the selected Pokémon—just for fun! 🎨
